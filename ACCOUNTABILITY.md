# 📊 Accountability System - Track Your Progress

## 🎯 Welcome to the Honor System (With Teeth)

This isn't Big Brother watching you. This is **YOU** holding **YOURSELF** accountable, with the **CODERCOPS community** as your witnesses.

---

## 🔥 The Core Principle

**PUBLIC COMMITMENT = HIGHER COMPLETION RATE**

Research shows:

- **Private goal:** 10% completion rate
- **Shared with one person:** 65% completion rate
- **Public commitment with regular updates:** 95% completion rate

**That's why you MUST:**

✅ Post daily in Discord #100daysofaiengineer
✅ Share on social media with #100DaysOfAIEngineer
✅ Commit code to GitHub daily
✅ Complete weekly check-ins

---
