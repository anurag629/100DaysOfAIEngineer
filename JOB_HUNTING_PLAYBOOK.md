**Wednesday:** Learning/insight share

```

Learned a valuable lesson building RAG systems:

Retrieval quality matters MORE than model size.

A well-tuned vector search with a smaller LLM outperforms a large LLM with poor retrieval.

Focus on:
✓ Embedding quality
✓ Chunk strategy
✓ Re-ranking
✓ Context window usage

What's your RAG optimization tip?

#LLMs #RAG #AIEngineering

## 💰 Step 7: Salary Negotiation

### **Know Your Worth:**

**AI/ML Engineer Salaries (US, 2025):**

**Entry-Level (0-2 years):**

- Small companies / startups: $80k - $120k
- Mid-size companies: $100k - $140k
- Big Tech: $120k - $180k (+ equity + bonus)

**Mid-Level (2-5 years):**

- Small companies: $120k - $160k
- Mid-size: $140k - $180k
- Big Tech: $180k - $250k+ (total comp)

**Your target after 100 days: $90k - $130k depending on location and company size**

(Adjust for your country/region)

---

### **Negotiation Strategy:**

**1. Always Negotiate**

- Companies expect it
- You're leaving money on the table if you don't
- Worst case: they say no

**2. Delay Salary Discussion**

- "I'd like to learn more about the role first"
- "I'm flexible, what's the budget for this role?"
- Never give number first

**3. When You Must Give a Number:**

- Research using levels.fyi, Glassdoor
- Give a range, not exact number
- Aim high (you can always come down)

**Example:**

```

"Based on my research and the value I'd bring with my expertise in [areas], I'm targeting $110k-$130k, but I'm flexible based on the full package including equity, benefits, and growth opportunities."

```

**4. Negotiate Beyond Salary:**

- Equity/stock options
- Signing bonus
- Remote work flexibility
- Learning/conference budget
- Start date
- PTO/vacation days

**5. Multiple Offers = Leverage**

- Always interview with multiple companies
- Use offers to negotiate
- "I have another offer at $X, can you match?"

---

## 📧 Follow-Up Strategies

### **After Application:**

- Wait 5-7 days
- Send polite follow-up email
- Reference your projects

**Template:**
