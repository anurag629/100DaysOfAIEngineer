**Days 29-35 | Phase 2 → Phase 3 Transition**

---

## 📊 What You Covered

### **Days 29-30: PROJECT 2 - Image Classifier Web App**
- Complete image classification system
- Web interface (Flask/Streamlit)
- Model deployment
- >90% accuracy requirement

### **Days 31-35: Computer Vision - Object Detection**
- Introduction to object detection
- YOLO architecture
- YOLO implementation
- Real-time detection

---

## ✅ Weekly Checkpoint - PROJECT 2 GATE

**PROJECT 2 REQUIREMENTS (MUST COMPLETE):**
- [ ] Model achieves >90% accuracy
- [ ] Web interface functional
- [ ] Can deploy locally
- [ ] Comprehensive README with setup instructions
- [ ] Can explain CNN architecture choices
- [ ] Posted in Discord forum for review
- [ ] Received peer feedback

**⚠️ CANNOT proceed to Week 6 until Project 2 is production-ready.**

## 🧪 Knowledge Verification

**Image Classification:**
```
Q: Explain your Project 2 architecture and why you chose it
Q: How did you achieve >90% accuracy?
Q: What preprocessing steps did you apply?
```

**Object Detection:**
```
Q: What's the difference between classification and detection?
Q: How does YOLO detect multiple objects in one pass?
Q: What is IoU and why is it important?
```

**Score: ___/6**

## 💻 Week 5 Integration Project

**Extend Project 2:**
- Add confidence threshold control
- Implement batch prediction
- Add error analysis dashboard
- Deploy to cloud (optional but recommended)

## 🔧 Common Week 5 Struggles

### **"Project 2 not reaching 90% accuracy"**
- Use more aggressive data augmentation
- Try different pre-trained models (EfficientNet often works well)
- Ensure sufficient training epochs
- Use learning rate scheduling
- Check dataset quality and class balance

### **"Deployment is confusing"**
- Start with Streamlit (easier than Flask)
- Test locally before any cloud deployment
- Use simple file upload interface first
- Gradio is also beginner-friendly

### **"YOLO implementation overwhelming"**
- Use pre-trained YOLO first (YOLOv5/YOLOv8)
- Focus on inference before training
- Understand architecture conceptually before code details

## 🚀 Preparing for Week 6

**Coming:** Advanced YOLO, Semantic Segmentation, U-Net

**To prepare:**
- Master object detection basics
- Review convolution operations again
- Get comfortable with bounding boxes and annotations
