## 💻 Week 3 Integration Project

**Build: Custom Neural Network Library**

Implement from scratch (without PyTorch/TensorFlow):

- Multi-layer neural network class
- Forward propagation
- Backpropagation
- SGD optimizer
- Train on a simple dataset (XOR or small classification)

Then rebuild the same thing in PyTorch and compare.

## 🔧 Common Week 3 Struggles

### **"Backpropagation math is overwhelming"**

- Focus on chain rule intuition
- Draw computation graphs
- Watch 3Blue1Brown videos
- Implement simple 2-layer network first

### **"PyTorch syntax is confusing"**

- Practice with small examples
- Use PyTorch documentation extensively
- Compare with NumPy to understand differences
- Build muscle memory through repetition

### **"MNIST accuracy stuck below 95%"**

- Check learning rate (try 0.01, 0.001)
- Add more layers or neurons
- Train for more epochs
- Verify data normalization
