## 💻 Code Challenge: Week 1 Integration Project

### **Build This to Prove Mastery:**

**Project: Exploratory Data Analysis Pipeline**

Create a complete EDA pipeline that:

1. Loads a dataset using Pandas
2. Cleans and preprocesses the data
3. Performs statistical analysis
4. Creates at least 5 different visualizations
5. Generates a summary report

**Requirements:**

- Must use NumPy for numerical operations
- Must use Pandas for data manipulation
- Must use Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization
- Code must be modular (separate functions)
- Must be documented with docstrings

**Datasets to use (pick one):**

- Titanic dataset
- Iris dataset
- Any Kaggle dataset you're interested in

**Deliverable:**

- Jupyter notebook with analysis
- README explaining findings
- Posted in Discord forum for review

## 🔧 Common Week 1 Struggles & Solutions

### **Problem 1: "NumPy broadcasting is confusing"**
**Solution:**

- Review broadcasting rules visually with diagrams
- Practice with simple examples before complex ones
- Use `.shape` to debug dimension issues
- Resource: [NumPy Broadcasting Tutorial](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.broadcasting.html)

### **Problem 2: "Pandas operations are overwhelming"**
**Solution:**

- Focus on core operations: read, filter, groupby, merge
- Use `.head()` constantly to check intermediate results
- Chain operations step by step, not all at once
- Resource: Pandas documentation + cheat sheets

### **Problem 3: "Math review is taking too long"**
**Solution:**

- Don't get stuck in math rabbit holes
- Understand concepts, not proofs
- You'll reinforce math by using it in ML algorithms
- Move forward, revisit math as needed

### **Problem 4: "Visualizations look ugly"**
**Solution:**

- Don't spend hours on styling in Week 1
- Focus on correct plot type for data
- Use Seaborn defaults (they look good)
- Improve styling gradually over 100 days

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Can You Continue?

### **Honest Self-Assessment:**

**Answer honestly:**

❓ Did I actually complete all 7 days, or did I skip/half-do some?
❓ Can I build a basic data analysis pipeline without tutorials?
❓ Do I understand NumPy and Pandas well enough to use them in ML?
❓ Have I posted in Discord and on social media as committed?

**If you answered NO to any question:**

- ⚠️ **Do NOT move to Week 2 yet**
- 🔧 **Fix the gaps first**
- 💪 **It's better to be solid on Week 1 than to build on shaky foundation**

**If you answered YES to all:**

- ✅ **You're ready for Week 2!**
- 🎉 **Celebrate this milestone - 7% done!**
- 🚀 **Week 2 will build on this foundation**

---

## 🎯 Bottom Line

**Week 1 is your foundation. Everything builds on this.**

**Don't rush. Make sure you're solid.**

**7 days done. 93 to go. Keep pushing!** 💪🔥
