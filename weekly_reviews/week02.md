## 💻 Code Challenge: Week 2 Integration

### **Build This to Prove Mastery:**

**Project: Multi-Algorithm Comparison Pipeline**

Create a pipeline that:
1. Loads and preprocesses a classification dataset
2. Trains 4 different models:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree
   - Random Forest
   - Your choice
3. Compares models using multiple metrics
4. Visualizes results with plots
5. Selects best model and explains why

**Requirements:**
- Clean, modular code
- Proper train/test split
- Cross-validation
- Clear documentation
- Results visualization

**Post in Discord forum with title: "[Week 2 Project] Multi-Model Comparison"**

## 🔧 Common Week 2 Struggles & Solutions

### **Problem 1: "Project 1 not achieving 0.90 ROC-AUC"**
**Solutions:**
- Try feature engineering (create new features)
- Use feature scaling/normalization
- Try different algorithms
- Tune hyperparameters
- Check for data leakage
- Ensure proper cross-validation

### **Problem 2: "Gradient descent math is confusing"**
**Solutions:**
- Focus on intuition: finding minimum of cost function
- Visualize with 2D plots
- Implement simple version from scratch
- Don't get stuck on calculus details
- Understanding > memorization

### **Problem 3: "Too many algorithms to remember"**
**Solutions:**
- Focus on when to use each, not every detail
- Create comparison chart
- Build intuition through practice
- They'll become clearer as you use them more

### **Problem 4: "Project 1 taking too long"**
**Solutions:**
- Start with simple baseline model
- Don't over-engineer initially
- Get something working end-to-end first
- Iterate and improve
- Ask for help in Discord if stuck >2 hours
