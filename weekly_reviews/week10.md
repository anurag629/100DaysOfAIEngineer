## 💻 Week 10 Integration Project

**Build: LLM-Powered Application with LangChain**

Create an application that:

1. Uses advanced prompting
2. Implements chains with LangChain
3. Uses vector database for context
4. Fine-tunes a small model (optional)

**Post: "[Week 10] LangChain + Vector DB Application"**
