## 🔧 Common Week 13 Challenges

### **"Multi-modal models are resource-intensive"**
- Use smaller models or quantized versions
- Leverage cloud GPUs (Colab Pro)
- Batch processing for efficiency

### **"RL is hard to debug"**
- Start with simple environments (CartPole, etc.)
- Focus on understanding reward design
- Use established algorithms (DQN, PPO)

### **"Stable Diffusion requires too much GPU"**
- Use Hugging Face Diffusers with optimization
- Try smaller models first
- Use cloud inference APIs
