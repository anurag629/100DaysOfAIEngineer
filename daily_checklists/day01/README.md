## ✅ Today's Tasks

### 1. 📚 Conceptual Understanding

- [ ] Read through learning resources
- [ ] Watch at least one video tutorial
- [ ] Take notes on key concepts
- [ ] Understand why this topic matters

### 2. 💻 Hands-On Practice

- [ ] Set up your environment
- [ ] Complete coding exercises
- [ ] Experiment with examples
- [ ] Debug and troubleshoot issues

### 3. 🚀 Mini Project

**Build:** Image Filter Using NumPy

Create basic image filters (grayscale, blur, edge detection) using only NumPy array operations. No image libraries allowed!

**Requirements:**

- Load image as NumPy array
- Implement grayscale conversion
- Create a blur filter using convolution
- Apply edge detection
- Save filtered images

### 4. 📝 Documentation

- [ ] Comment your code clearly
- [ ] Update this README with your learnings
- [ ] Note any challenges you faced
- [ ] Write down questions for the community
