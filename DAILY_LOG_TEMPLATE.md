## Tips for Effective Logging

1. **Be Consistent:** Log daily, even if brief
2. **Be Honest:** Document struggles, not just wins
3. **Be Specific:** "Learned CNNs" < "Implemented ResNet50 and achieved 95% accuracy"
4. **Include Code:** Link to actual implementations
5. **Add Visuals:** Screenshots, plots, diagrams
6. **Reflect:** Don't just list, think about *why*
7. **Review Regularly:** Weekly and monthly reviews are crucial
8. **Keep It Simple:** Don't let logging take more than 10-15 minutes
9. **Make It Yours:** Customize this template to fit your style
10. **Share Progress:** Consider making logs public for accountability

## Day 1: NumPy Basics

**Date:** 2025-01-15
**Phase:** Phase 1 - Foundations
**Time Spent:** 3 hours

### 📚 Learning Objectives

- [x] Understand NumPy arrays vs Python lists
- [x] Master array creation and manipulation
- [x] Learn vectorization for performance

### 📖 What I Learned

**Key Concepts:**
1. Broadcasting - How NumPy handles operations between arrays of different shapes
2. Vectorization - Replacing loops with array operations for 100x speedup
3. Views vs Copies - Understanding memory efficiency

**New Terminology:**
- **Broadcasting:** Implicit element-wise operation on arrays of different shapes
- **ndarray:** N-dimensional array, the core NumPy object

**Interesting Insights:**
- NumPy operations are 10-100x faster than Python loops
- Most ML libraries (PyTorch, TensorFlow) use similar array concepts

### 💻 Code Implemented

**Files Created:**
- `day01_numpy_basics.ipynb` - Basic operations and exercises
- `image_filter.py` - Mini project: image filters

**Key Code Snippets:**

```python
# Vectorized normalization (no loops!)
def normalize(arr):
    return (arr - arr.mean()) / arr.std()

# Applied to 1M element array in 0.002s
```

### 🎯 Mini Project

**Project:** Image Blur Filter

**Description:**
Implemented Gaussian blur using NumPy array operations

**Results:**
- Successfully blurred 1024x1024 image
- Processing time: 0.15s
- Learned convolution basics

**Challenges:**
- Understanding array slicing for neighbor operations
- Solved by drawing diagrams and testing on small 3x3 arrays

### 💡 Key Takeaways

1. Always think in arrays, not loops
2. Understanding shapes is crucial
3. NumPy is the foundation for all ML/AI

### ⏭️ Tomorrow's Plan

**Topic:** Advanced NumPy & Linear Algebra

**Goals:**
- [ ] Matrix operations
- [ ] Random sampling
- [ ] Build image filter mini project
